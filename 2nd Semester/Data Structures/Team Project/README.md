# Data Structures Project 2020-2021

## General Information


This is a team project , was developed by me and [chriszaro](https://github.com/chriszaro). 

- Used Programming language is C++. <br />
- Header files are located in Headers folder. <br />
- All .cpp files including main, are located in Sources folder. 

<br />

## What can you find in this folder ?
In this folder you can find : 
- the [project description (GR)](https://github.com/tsiggi/CSD-Auth/blob/main/2nd%20Semester/Data%20Structures/Team%20Project/Project%20Discription.pdf) [ðŸ’¾](https://github.com/tsiggi/CSD-Auth/raw/main/2nd%20Semester/Data%20Structures/Team%20Project/Project%20Discription.pdf),
- the code in [headers ðŸ“‚](https://github.com/tsiggi/CSD-Auth/tree/main/2nd%20Semester/Data%20Structures/Team%20Project/Headers) and [source ðŸ“‚](https://github.com/tsiggi/CSD-Auth/tree/main/2nd%20Semester/Data%20Structures/Team%20Project/Sources) folder,
- and a [report (GR)](https://github.com/tsiggi/CSD-Auth/blob/main/2nd%20Semester/Data%20Structures/Team%20Project/Data%20Structures%20Assignment%20Report.pdf) that helps with understanding.

## Implementation & Output

Implemented Data Structures :
- Unsorted Array
- Sorted Array
- Binary Search Tree
- AVL Tree
- Hash Table
<br />

This project takes a text file (e.g [small-file.txt](https://github.com/tsiggi/CSD-Auth/blob/main/2nd%20Semester/Data%20Structures/Team%20Project/small-file.txt)), and for every differend word that apears, it stores, the word and the times it apears, in the above data structures. <br />
After that, it saves the data stored in those data structures, in the [output.txt](https://github.com/tsiggi/CSD-Auth/blob/main/2nd%20Semester/Data%20Structures/Team%20Project/output.txt) file. <br />
Finally, the program also outputs : <br />
<img src="Output.png" > <br />
Which is the time that each stucture takes, to shearch the first 5000 words of the input file (e.g small-file.txt).

<br />

There may be some changes, in the assignment, from year to year.
